    <strong>Content warning:</strong> This page discusses terrorism and mass-casualty violence
    in a strictly historical and analytical context. It does not glorify or justify extremist ideology.

  <h2>Who He Was</h2>
  <p>
    Osama bin Laden (1957–2011) was the founder and leader of al-Qaeda, a transnational extremist
    organization responsible for numerous terrorist attacks. He became one of the most influential
    figures in modern extremist movements and a central target of international counterterrorism efforts.
  </p>

  <h2>Ideology and Organization</h2>
  <p>
    Bin Laden promoted a violent extremist ideology that framed attacks on civilians as legitimate.
    Al-Qaeda operated through decentralized cells, using propaganda, recruitment, and coordinated attacks
    to spread fear and instability.
  </p>

  <h2>Major Attacks Attributed to al-Qaeda</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1998 — U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania</li>
    <li>2000 — USS <em>Cole</em> bombing</li>
    <li>2001 — September 11 attacks in the United States</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Global Impact</h2>
  <p>
    The attacks linked to al-Qaeda resulted in the deaths of thousands of civilians and reshaped global
    politics, security policy, and international relations. They led to prolonged military conflicts,
    expanded surveillance programs, and lasting geopolitical consequences.
  </p>

  <h2>Death and Aftermath</h2>
  <p>
    Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011. His death marked a symbolic blow to al-Qaeda,
    though extremist movements continue to exist in fragmented forms.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Studying figures like bin Laden is not about fascination or notoriety. It is about understanding
    how extremist ideologies form, how they spread, and how they cause real-world harm — so they can be
    prevented in the future.
